## Why Would I Waste My Time Building a Website?


I will not sit here and claim that creating a website was an extraordinarily original idea.
However, I knew it would take a considerable amount of time. Especially to make it appear the way
I want it to (which is still doesn't, and perhaps never will). My first thought is that it would be a
great way to display my school and professional work. Then, I became excited at the thought of creating original
content in the form of blog posts and videos. All of the sudden, I was hit with the brilliant idea of organizing
my photos on the site to better show the places I have gone.

**Hold Up**

This became a ridiculous daydream as I realized there is already forums and websites for opinionated blog posts.
Instagram and YouTube already serve as the premier places to post pictures and videos.
So, why would I create a website when it is not necessary?

**Let me try to explain myself:**

		1. There doesn't always need to be a necessary reason to do something, but sometimes something is of interest to you and motivates you to action - the idea of a personal website motivated me
		
		2. I rarely use popular social media like YouTube and Instagram to post content, so why not have another medium for myself?
		
		3. It may be a good skill to learn how to build parts of a website since it seems like the technology fad may not be going away?
		
		4. Lastly, it is April 16th, 2020; and I am in quarantine at my parents house.
