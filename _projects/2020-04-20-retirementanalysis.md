I will not sit here and claim that creating a website was an extraordinarily original idea. 
I knew it would take a considerable amount of time. Especially to make it appear the way
I want it to (which is still doesn't, and perhaps never will). My first thought was that it would be a
great way to display my school and professional work. Then, I became excited at the thought of creating original
content in the form of blog posts and videos. All of the sudden, I was hit with the brilliant idea of organizing
my photos on the site to better show the places I have gone.
