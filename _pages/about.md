Currently, I am a senior at The University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management where I am studying Finance and Analytics. After graduation this May, I intend to leverage my analytical skills to contribute value to a company
immediately. In the future, I hope to work on projects that utilize my creativity and curiosity as well as my business accumen. In general, I am interested in Asset Management, Corporate Finance, Data Manipulation,
and Entrepreneurship. A life goal of mine is to be part of a startup or small business in some capacity.

Outside of work and education, I have many hobbies and interests. Some of my interests include swimming, reading, traveling, woodworking, and sports - mainly golf, football, and basketball. During the summer, you can expect me to be at
the beach or outside playing basketball. Recently, I acquired my scuba diving certification which I hope to utilize in the near future. Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me!
